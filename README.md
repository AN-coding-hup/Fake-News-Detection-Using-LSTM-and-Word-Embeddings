# Fake News Detection Using LSTM and Word Embeddings
This project aims to detect fake news articles using a deep learning approach based on LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks. The model uses a custom embedding layer trained on a labeled news dataset to classify articles as real or fake.

# Features
âœ… Preprocessing and cleaning of news data

âœ… Tokenization and padding of text sequences

âœ… Trainable Embedding layer to learn word representations

âœ… LSTM-based neural network for sequence classification

âœ… Visualizations: word clouds, token distribution, class counts

âœ… Model evaluation with accuracy and loss metrics

âœ… Easily extendable to use pretrained embeddings (GloVe, FastText)

# Technologies Used
Python

TensorFlow / Keras

NLTK

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

Scikit-learn

# Dataset
A labeled dataset of news articles where each article is classified as:

1 = Real

0 = Fake

The dataset is cleaned and tokenized before being fed into the model.

# How to Run

ðŸ“ˆ Results
Achieves competitive accuracy and stable training performance on binary fake news classification. Embedding + LSTM architecture shows strong capability in capturing text patterns.

ðŸ“Œ Future Work
Integrate pretrained embeddings (GloVe, FastText)

Add GRU/BiLSTM variants

Deploy as a REST API using FastAPI or Flask
